## How it all started

When I was in elementry school, my friend Rick had an uncle who was radio amateur.
One day I came along with my friend to visit his uncle and when I saw all that fascinating radio equipment I was hooked.
Back home I began to experiment with basic stuff like a crystal radio and started to read electronics magazines, like Elektor (which was called Elektuur in The Netherlands back then).
Within a few years I was buidling amplifiers for a few of my friends and experimented with small radio transmitters.
As an avid reader of every issue of Elektuur, there was this defining moment in my life when the May 1977 edition dropped on the doormat.
It had an article about a microprocessor from National Semiconductors with the nickname **SC/MP** (its official part number was ISP-8A/500D).
I ordered the PCB from Elektuur and went to the only electronics shop in my area (DIL Elektronics in Rotterdam) to get all the parts.
While waiting for the PCB to arrive, I dove into the details of the SC/MP instructionset and started to write down a few small programs (in Hex code!) I could run on it.
The Elektuur SC/MP was a very basic system with only 256 bytes of RAM, DIP-switches for address and data entry and just 8 LEDs as 'output device'.
I still remember the thrill I felt when, after quickly building it, I programmed a simple running lights program and saw the LEDs lighting up one by one.

## A little background

After experimenting with the very limited SC/MP system for a while, I wanted more.
Elektuur had published a few articles about expanding it with memory, I/O etc., but by then I had found out about other microprocessors that were more advanced like the MOS 6502 and Motorola 6800 Microprocessers.
I particularly liked the clean en powerfull instructionset and registers of the MC6800 and because parts were not that easy to come by, I bought an evaluation kit in 1978 that had all the parts needed to assemble a complete system: the **Motorola MEK6800D2 Evaluation Kit II**, which had been introduced in 1976 but I only found out about it in 1977.
The MEK6800D2 had an hexadecimal keypad with additional keys for running, storing, reading and stepping through memory and registers, and it had 6 7-segment displays as 'output device'.
Somehow I have lost (misplaced) it along the way and now that I am growing older (and much more grey hair) I often think back to those days.

While going to some old stuff I had kept in a box on the attic, I discovered the Keyboard/Display module of the MEK/D2, but somehow I seem to have lost the CPU/Memory module.
Therefor I set out on a journey to find a Kit on the internet and there where a few offerings on eBay.
Some in questionable shape with messy modifications, some still in good shape and ever working order.
I made an offer and acquired one that was shipped to my from the United States.

This documents the journey I took to dive into the world of the original MEK/D2 again and expanding it with RAM, serial interfaces, EPROMs, and ultimately even Floppy disks.
One objective I had was to stay as close to the original designs and parts that were available in the late seventies as possible and trying to refrain from using modern parts.

## Unpacking and preliminary testing

While waiting for the MEK/D2 to arrive, I digged up as much information on the internet as I could; what a difference with the time I originally worked with the MEK/D2 as that was pre-Internet!
I also bought the original Assembler Programming Manual, which I never had in my youth, and even some original datasheets of core parts of the system, like MC6800, MC6810, MC6820 and MC6850.
The MEK/D2 arrived, complete with the manual and and an old power supply suitable for 110V/60Hz AC which I dumped in the trash bin and connected my Lab PSU to test it.

I fired the MEK/D2 up and immediatle was welcomed by the dash '-' prompt of the JBUG monitor; what a relief as that meant I probably didn't have to troubleshoot the Kit by reseating ICs, replacing capacitors or ICs.

Somehow, I immediately remembered the basics of examining and entering data in memory locations and started further testing.
As an execerse and test of the Kit, I walked through the example in the manual and run that tiny test program, which also worked flawlessly.
As you can tell from the picture below, the MEK/D2 was still in very good and original shape with all of its 7-segment displays working correctly; no patches or wiring on the boards and no traces that were cut through.
Actually, ot looks like this Kit wasn't used very extensive...

![The MEK/D2 in action](MEKD2_2.png)

As can be seen on the display of the Lab PSU, the MEK/D2 in its 'naked' form draws about 1 Amp of power at 5V, roughly 5 Watt.
My preliminary conclusion was that the MEK/D2 was working correctly.
Time to start looking into some of the details of this Kit and the Motorola 6800 family as a whole.

### Overview of the MEK6800D2 Evaluation Kit II

#### Main components

First, for those not very familiar with the Motorola MEK6800D2 Kit, let's summarize the main specifications:

- The **MC6800** MPU runs at 614.4 kHz, while the MPU could run on 1 MHz just fine.
  This strange clock frequency was choosen by Motorola so that they could easily get a 2400 Hz signal for the cassette interface by divinding it by 256, saving a few additional parts. The MC6871B was used as clock generator and it is a rather specilized clock device because the 6800 MPU needed two non-overlapping clock signals, called 'Phi 1' and 'Phi 2'.
  Later models, like the 6802 and 6809 had the clock circuitry on the chip, largely simplifiying the designs.
- The **MCM6830** is a 1024x8 ROM IC that is factory burned with the JBUG monitor program - the BIOS and OS if you like.
- An **MCM6810** is sitting right next to that ROM and provides 128 bytes of static RAM for the JBUG monitor.
- Two additional **MCM6810** RAM ICs provide 256 bytes of user RAM. They are located at the bottom of the board near the 68-pin EXORciser bus connector. And there is room for two more next to them.
- There are two **MC6820** PIAs or _Peripheral Interface Adapter_ ICs near the connectors at the top. One of them is used to interface the keyboard and 7-segment displays, the other is available for the user. Each PIA provides 2x8 I/O lines that can be programmed individually as input or output. It should be noted that the 68xx family of MPU's has no dedicated I/O space or instructions like the 80XX family, you access these devices by accessing certain memory locations.
- An **MC6850** ACIA, or _Asychronous Communicatons Interface Adapter_, is also present to provide serial I/O which can be used for the cassette interface. Note that the cassette interface logic is located on the Keyboard/Display PCB.
- There is room for an **optional (E)PROM** on the board and out of the box it supports 3 types: 
- Not much else on the MPU/Memory board, except a few 3-state buffers and address decoder ICs.
- There is a bit of room on the MPU/Memory board to add additional components that can for instance provide a second serial interface for an RS232 connection with a terminal.
- A **hexadecimal keyboard** is located on the second PCB and holds the 16 hex-keys as well as 8 additional keys used for controller the JBUG monitor.
- Six **7-segment displays** are also on this board, layed out in 4 digits for address and 2 for the data.

#### Memory layout

The MEK6800D2 is hard-wired for a certain memory layout.
The 6800 MPU has 16 address lines and is capable of directly addressing 64K of memory, but that space has to be shared with I/O devices.
Since the Kit has very simple address decoding circuits, the memory is divided in 8 blocks of 8K each; the lower 8K of memory space is reserved for onboard RAM (although the board can only hold 768 bytes).

The MCM6830 ROM with the JBUG monitor is located at $XXXX - $XXXX and since the address decoding doesn'tlook at address lines below Axxxx, this 1K block is repeated accress that entire memory range.
The optional (E)PROM is destined for address range $xxxx - $xxxx.

The two PIAs occupy 4 bytes each in address range $xxxx - $xxxx and $xxxx - $xxxx rerspectively. The ACIA is accessible at $xxxx - $xxxx.

This result in the following memory layout:

![MEK6800D2 Memory layout](MEKD2_memory_layout.png)






A low on the _RAM_ line is used to indicated that this onboard memory is being accessed.
Normally this line goes to the MCM6810 RAM IC's as one of the Chip Select (CS) lines to enable them, but since that signal is made available on the EXORciser bus, it can also be used to replace the onboard memory with an expansion board that can hold much more memory. In that case the onboard memory should be disabled.

There is also room for



## Expanding the Kit



### Clock challenges

The clock generator IC used in the original MEK was an MC6871B rated at 614.4 kHz.

<alert>Fun fact: 
</alert>

I could only find the MC6871B in a few obsure places for high prices and no guarantee they would work at all.
This prompted me to look for alternatives, which turned out to be it's sibbling the MC6875 which I found more readily available on reputable retro computer shops like [Corshamtech](https://www.corshamtech.com/product/mc6875-clock-generator/).
Of course that ment that I could not generate the 2400 Hz signal that easy anymore.
More on that later.

### JBUG ROM replacement

Another hurdle to take was the 1024x8 bit [MCM6830 ROM](/datasheets/MCM6830.pdf) programmed (hard-wired) with the JBUG monitor program.
I decided to design a replacement circuit based on an EPROM to stay as close to the original design as possible, as I only want to use parts that were available around that time.
A search on the internet archives for information came up with the Motorola datasheet for the MCM68A30A/MCM68B30A, from which I could get the details of the pin assignments and other details.
However, as the datasheet states: "The active level of the Chip Select inputs and the memory content are defined by the customer".
Translated: Motorola 'backed' a configuration in that ROM with two Chip Selects that I should reproduce somehow, but details of the 6830 in the MEK6800D2 are scarce.

The Vintage Computer Federation forum had a [few posts](https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/gw-6830-1-a-replacement-for-motorola-6830-mask-roms.79067/) from November 2020 about a guy creating a plug-in replacement using an Atmel AVR with built-in EEPROM to mimic the behaviour of the ROM and the Chip Select lines.
I asked a follow-up question in that forum and promptly got a reply from two different people with more details.
With that input, I could start designing for the 6830 replacement, which - as I stated - should be a component from that same seventies period.
The 2708 EPROM was a logical choice, although it meant I had to add additional voltage levels, like -12V, to drive the 2708.
I could also opt for a 2716 type EPROM, which did not need -12V, but for now I will try and get my hands on a few 2708's and if that fails, I'll switch to using 2716's.
And in both cases, I also have to build an EPROM programmer and UV eraser!

### Optional EPROMs

At address $C000 an optional PROM can be used that could be any 2708 (1Kx8) EPROM or pin-compatible IC.
I never used it in the original MEK but the schematics mention that an MC68708, MCM7641 or MCM68317 could be used.
These days 2708's are no longer produced, but on eBay there are still many parts available, so I decided to order a few.
